  <h1>Asking Good Questions, A Review</h1>

   		After looking back at some of my questions over the past few months, I found a few trends. I found that I am very straight forward, and consequently, pretty clear. At the same time, I usually throw in least one exclamation point or dash to soften things up -- I don't want to come off as a tone-deaf robot. (How's that for an example!) My questions were usually are on the shorter side, and they always got a response. With that being said, I did not ask too many questions, so the sample size is not great.

    	Going forward, I hope to continue to analyze my questions. There seem to be many benefits of asking a 'good' question: better response percentages, better response times, more complete answers, etc. In a educational setting, there are few things as valuable. I am looking foward to building my skill set.
