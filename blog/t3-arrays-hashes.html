   		An array is an ordered list of "things." These "things" that make up the list are called elements. Each has its own index place - with the list starting at place 0. (Example: a = [a,b,c] - a is the array and a,b, and c are elements that fill the indexes of 0,1, and 2, respectively.)
    </p>
    	Similarly, hash is a collection of paired "things." However, instead of an integer-indexed list, the pairs are made up of keys and values. With the most current version of Ruby, hashes are also considered to be ordered - just like arrays. (Example: a = {"a":1,"b":2} - a is the hash with keys of "a" and "b," and the associated values of 1 and 2.)
