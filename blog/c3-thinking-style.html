   		The DBC experience has been hard to guage recently. It has been rewarding to learn about learning styles, coder empathy, and self awareness; however, exercising these concepts has been diffucult. Currently, scheduling time to fully participate for DBC is the limiting factor. The added stress of extreme time constraints is definitely tainting the experience.

    	Having said that, going back to pre-phase-0 lessons, I remember I was categorized as a concrete random and abstract sequential. The descriptions of what these terms mean were somewhat surprising. I would not describe myself as a concrete random, mainly because I almost never approach problems in a trial-and-error manner. In the coming weeks, I wonder if consciously thinking about my mind style will change the way I think or approach problems. In the end, is the goal to end up at the intersection of all four mind styles and to be as versatile as possible?
