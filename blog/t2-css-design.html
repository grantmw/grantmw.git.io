  <h1>What are the differences between relative, absolute, and fixed positioning?</h1>

    <p>
   		Relative, absolute, and fixed are types of positioning. In your CSS file, you can set/ change these types of positioning. Use "position: ______" - and fill in the blank with the type.
    </p>
    <p>
    	The default position is always set to static. 
    	<ul>
    		<li>The absolute position sets the position relative to the closest non-static object (div, etc.). If there are no other non-static objects, the position is relative to html. </li>
    		<li>Relative sets all positional movements relative to the static position.</li>
    		<li> Fixed sticks the object to a certain part of the screen. It does not move regardless of scrolling. </li>
    	</ul>
    </p>>
  </div>
</body>
